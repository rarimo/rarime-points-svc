  summary: Claim or reserve points
  description: |
    - Common case: update event status to _claimed_ and accrue points.
      Event must be _fulfilled_ by user. Updated balance is included.
    - Special weekly points:
      - a) passport verified: _open_ or _reserved_ event can be claimed with accruing points;
      - b) passport not verified: _open_ event can only be _reserved_.
    
    You may check whether the user has verified passport by the `is_verified`
    attribute in the balance.
