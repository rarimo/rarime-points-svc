  summary: Create points balance
  description: |
    Create an empty balance for authorized user who makes the request. Rank is included
    in response.
    
    This operation might be time-consuming, because `open` events should be added for
    the new account synchronously (to display them right after the request).
    
    If balance already exists, but it is disabled (it was not referred by another user,
    but has fulfilled some event), you should use PATCH balances/{nullifier} endpoint as well.
